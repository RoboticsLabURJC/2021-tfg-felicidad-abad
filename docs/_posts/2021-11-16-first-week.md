This first week the task was simple: review the Python syntax so I can use this language on the rest of the TFG.

I made some functions and two simple games:

* The dragon game: where you have to choose a cave (right or left) and test your luck; you may find a nice dragon which will give you money and points or an hostile dragon; end of the adventure
* Guess number: after you indicate the length of the number you want to guess, the game will ask you for a number and give a response with how many you positions you got right
