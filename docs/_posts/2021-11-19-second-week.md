This week I had two main task:

* Make a review of GitHub.
* Check the basics of Selenium

For GitHub I tried to use issues. I made one "Test issue", added a description and assigned a pull request to it. Just to see how to create, close and work with them.

The pull request consisted in merging two branches and try to solve the conflicts that arised while doing it.

I think both tries ended up with a successful result.

As for Selenium, I did some simple test: open a web page on Chrome, accept the popup with cookies, make some searches and enter on a specific result.
