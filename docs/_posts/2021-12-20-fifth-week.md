As I continue to study the code of some files in the unibotics repository I helped solve a little issue!

I created an issue, cloned the repository, changed the code and tried it locally. After checking it worked, i created a pull request and linked it in the issue.
It was a simple thing, but as my first contribution to Unibotics I was glad it worked :)

After that, I'll continue studying the most important files in the repository & the path the user code follows in the platform.
