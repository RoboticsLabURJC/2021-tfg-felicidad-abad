The test for color_filter exercise are done. They are yet basic tests that check if the buttons on the page are clickable or not. There are many improvements to do in the future, but let's start with a basic version of them.

During this week I also updated part of the documentation in Robotics Academy repository and tried to do the color_filter exercise with a local deployment.

During this, i faced an error. I couldnt access the camera from the RADI container but I could access from another container, one I created myself.

I'll check this during the week.
