I added automatic tests using Selenium for the frontend of unibotics. One test for each button separately.

However, that solution was not very effective as it took a lot of time to run the whole test section even when i didn't had all the exercises added.

Thats why I stopped implementing them that way. Instead, I'll do a TestCase for each exercise and try the complete set of buttons.

Next week I'll add more information about that & hopefully I'll have the whole set of frontend tests finished :)
