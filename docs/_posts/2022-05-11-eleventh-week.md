This week I ended developing and evolving the frontend test por the unibotics-webserver repository.

There is a series of test for each exercise that is already in production. With this added now, the developer that makes a change in code can test that their solution or changes does not break the previous things. For example, other members of the team are now refactorizing the frontend. This automatic tests allow them to check if some button or something is missing before deploy.

I'll upload this post later with more information about the test :)
