The new approach was trying to make a script at the first level of the container.

It was a .sh script, which tried to execute the topics_testing script directly. It didn't work either, it seemed like I was missing something.

So I had to ask another intermediate script which begins to complicate things more that I would like. Having to add 3 scripts per exercise to test them is going to be a little complicated.
