The send_keys function didn't work, so now I have to look for another way of doing it.

There isn't a lot of information online about this, so looking for different approachs it's going to be a little difficult. I tried two different things now.
1. See if I was locating the editor right and looking at what type of element it is.
1. Trying to use the sendText( ) function.

But, as can be seen in the image above... another error.

At least I know I'm locating the editor and that it is a WebElement.
