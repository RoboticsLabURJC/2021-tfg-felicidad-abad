I kept looking through the week to see if there is any other way of inserting text using Selenium or external functions. But there isn't a lot of information about these things online, so all I could find was the ways I already tried.
1. send_keys()
1. sendText()
1. execute_script()

It is strange that all of them failed, specially as the last one is already being used in another project. But as we wait for my co-tutor availability to check it, we decided to pause the developing of functionality test and continue with the implementation of a vision exercise.
