This week, we are going to start with the implementation of a image processing exercise.

The idea is making an introduction one, so people could use it in the first stages of learning image processing. In order to do that I too had to understand a little bit more of it.

Thats why this week I made different things with opencv on local
1. Reproducing a video frame by frame
1. Making color filters
1. Finding borders
1. Checking colors
1. etc...

These seems to be simple a little challengues to people learning image processing, and if they are made step by step, I think they could be a good training to see how these basic things work.
