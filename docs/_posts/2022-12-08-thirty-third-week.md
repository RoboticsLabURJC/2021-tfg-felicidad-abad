This two weeks were dedicated to completely understanding the manager.py.

At a high level, its' functions were clear but the code is really extense. Because of that, I needed to debug a lot while using different exercises. This week I also learned about de logging module from python.

This module is really useful, cause it creates a log file with the name and the loggins you mark. It also has differents levels like debug, warning or error.

Once I understood the code I updated the documentation about it for others developers. I hope it will help them to understand a little more about the project :)
