The past week I was traveling, so I wasn't able to write something for the blog.

The flow of the functionality test is quite complex and also needs to add multiple things to everything that is already un production as two to three scripts were needed per exercise to perform the first version of the tests.

As one of the principles of the CI/CD is not affecting those things while implementing the test I though looking for a change would be good.

Thats how I started investigation which topics used each exercise. To my surprise, there were a lot of them who shared the same topic! For example, the follow_line and the obstacle_avoidance. Because of that, I started making a resume with the topics the exercises in production used, being able to reduce it to a few of them.

Thanks to that, I could effectively start looking for a simpler solution.
