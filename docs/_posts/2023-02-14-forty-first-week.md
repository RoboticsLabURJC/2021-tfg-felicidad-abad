As studied in the previous weeks, a lot of exercises share topic so now I reproduced the shell script of the previous weeks with the rest of topics.

As I tried them, I discovered that not all shared the same message format. So that was another thing I need to control in the mega Selenium script to avoid failures that are not caused by any change in the exercises.

Since I still had the problem with inserting code on the ACE Editor, I tested them using a D1 Deployment. Aparently, thay all seem to work well.

I hope I can complete the whole process soon.
