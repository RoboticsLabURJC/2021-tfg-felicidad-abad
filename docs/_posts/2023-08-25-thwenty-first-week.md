Once the error of the previos week got resolved, i could keep trying to make my script work.

I got a few more errors, for example, I was trying to inicialize a node with the same name that one that already existed and because of that I got various conflicts.

In the end, I just had to change the name of the node I was initiating. I put tha name "automatic_testing_fl". Oh! I forgot to add, I finally started with the follow_line exercise.

Once i did that change and executed again the script, I could read perfectly the positions of the robot.
